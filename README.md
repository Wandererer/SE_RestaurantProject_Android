# SE_RestaurantProject_Android
1. I use this project for SE class term project
2. This project for Restaurant Owner and Customer for owner using as manage their restaurant and customer for reservation and information about restaurant.
3. I study android programing about 2 weeks and made this project and using most of tecnique like Fragment, custom listview, so on......
4.  However this project fail because one of my team member didn't do his job so my other team member has to make server part then i thought it was perfect but my very important function for owner.  (he or she can decorate thier restaurant using drag and drop window, table, wall ....  )  but when i download restaurant db info. this info didn't add into my decorate Arraylist....
